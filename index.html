    <h2>All Hail King Jesus</h2>
    <p><i>[Verse 1]</i> <br>
    There was a moment when the lights went out <br>
    When death had claimed its victory <br>
    The King of love had given up His life <br>
    The darkest day in history <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Verse 2]</i> <br>
    There on a cross they made for sinners <br>
    For every curse His blood atoned <br>
    One final breath and it was finished <br>
    But not the end we could have known <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Pre-Chorus 1]</i> <br>
    For the earth began to shake, and the veil was torn <br>
    What sacrifice was made, as the heavens roared <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Chorus]</i> <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Lord of heaven and earth <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Savior of the world <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Verse 3]</i> <br>
    There was a moment when the sky lit up <br>
    A flash of light breaking through <br>
    When all was lost He crossed eternity <br>
    The King of life was on the move <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Pre-Chorus 2]</i> <br>
    For in a dark, cold tomb, where our Lord was laid <br>
    One miraculous breath, and we're forever changed <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Chorus]</i> <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Lord of heaven and earth <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Savior of the world <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Lord of heaven and earth <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Savior of the world <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Interlude]</i> <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Bridge]</i> <br>
    Let every knee, come bow before the King of kings <br>
    Let every tongue, confess that He is Lord <br>
    Lift up your shout, let us join with all of heaven <br>
    Singing ho-ho-ho-ho-holy <br>
    Singing ho-ho-ho-ho-holy <br>
    Crying out ho-ho-ho-ho-holy <br>
    Singing ho-ho-ho-ho-holy <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Chorus]</i> <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Lord of heaven and earth <br>
    And all hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Savior of the world <br>
    <i>[Interlude]</i> <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Post-Chorus]</i> <br>

    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail, King Jesus! <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Interlude]</i> <br>
     <br>
    <i>[Chorus]</i> <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Lord of heaven and earth <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Savior of the world <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Lord of heaven and earth <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
    All hail the Savior of the world <br>
    All hail, King Jesus <br>
